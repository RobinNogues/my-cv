# Personal CV Website - robin-nogues.com

This repository contains the source code for my personal CV and portfolio website, live at [robin-nogues.com](https://robin-nogues.com/).

It is designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects in a clean, modern, and responsive interface. The project is built with a microservice architecture, separating the frontend and backend concerns.

## ✨ Features

-   **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
-   **Comprehensive Sections:** Includes Professional Experience, Personal Projects, Skills, Education, and Certifications.
-   **Interactive UI:** Dark mode, smooth animations, active navigation link highlighting, animated burger menu and a "Back to Top" button.
-   **Contact Form:** A secure contact form with backend processing, input validation, and anti-spam (honeypot, API Rate Limiting) protection.
-   **Automated Deployment:** CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments to a live server.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

The project follows a microservice architecture, containerized and orchestrated with Docker and Docker Compose.

-   **Frontend (`my-cv-frontend`):**
    -   **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    -   **Purpose:** Serves the static website content.

-   **Backend (`my-cv-backend`):**
    -   **Language:** Python
    -   **Framework:** FastAPI
    -   **Purpose:** Handles contact form submissions, including data validation, sanitization, and sending emails.

-   **Infrastructure & DevOps:**
    -   **Web Server/Reverse Proxy:** Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and API Gateway, routing traffic to the appropriate service (`/api/*` to backend, others to frontend) and handling security.
    -   **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose for creating consistent and isolated environments for each service.
    -   **SSL/TLS:** Certbot for managing Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, with automated renewal via a cron job.
    -   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions automates building Docker images and deploying the application to the VPS on every push to the `main` branch.
    -   **Hosting:** Deployed on a Virtual Private Server (VPS).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, you need Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobinNogues/my-cv.git
cd my-cv
```

### 2. Configure Backend Environment

The backend requires environment variables to send emails via the contact form.

Navigate to the backend directory, copy the environment template, and fill in your credentials.

```bash
cd my-cv-backend
cp .env.template .env
```

Now, edit the `.env` file with your email provider's details. For Gmail, you would need to create a Google App Password.
If you don't use the Google SMTP server, you will need to change default server and port in the `EmailSender` instanciation.

### 3. Create Local SSL Certificate (for HTTPS)

To run the project with HTTPS locally, you need a self-signed SSL certificate.

Generate the certificate and private key using OpenSSL:


```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout reverse-proxy/local_certs/nginx.key \
    -out reverse-proxy/local_certs/nginx.crt
```

You will be prompted for some information. You can leave most fields blank by pressing Enter. For the "Common Name", it's important to use `localhost`.

### 4. Build and Run

From the **root directory** of the project (`my-cv/`), run the following command to build the images and start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The docker-compose.override.yml needs to be used for the local installation.

### 5. Access the Website

The website should now be running and accessible at https://localhost. Nginx will serve the frontend and proxy API requests to the backend.

The front will also be accessible at http://localhost:8081 if you don't want to use HTTPS, but the form won't work.

## 📚 API Documentation

The FastAPI backend provides automatic interactive API documentation. Once the services are running, you can access it via the Nginx proxy:

-   **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/api/docs
-   **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/api/redoc

## 📦 Production Deployment

These steps are for setting up the application on a production server with a live domain and enabling HTTPS with Let's Encrypt.

**Prerequisites:**
- Your domain's DNS A/AAAA record (`my-website.com`) must point to your VPS IP address.
- The project files are on your VPS.
- You have created the backend `.env` file as described in the "Getting Started" section.

### 1. Initial Certificate Generation

This is a one-time command to obtain your SSL certificates.

1.  Start all services:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    Your Nginx service should now be running and serving a basic HTTP site on port 80, which is required for the Certbot challenge.

2.  Run Certbot to generate the certificate. Replace `your-email@example.com` with your actual email.
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot \
        -d my-website.com \
        --email your-email@example.com \
        --agree-tos \
        --no-eff-email
    ```

3.  Once the certificate is successfully created, restart the reverse proxy to load the new SSL configuration:
    ```bash
    docker compose restart reverse-proxy
    ```
    Your site should now be accessible via `https://my-website.com`.

### 2. Automating Certificate Renewal

Let's Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days. The renewal process should be automated.

You can do it with a cron job. This job will run daily, attempts renewal, and reloads Nginx if a new certificate was obtained.

1.  Open the crontab editor: `crontab -e`
2.  Add the following line, replacing `/path/to/your/project` with the absolute path to your project's root directory on the VPS. It will try to renew the certificat every day at 4:17 AM (you can change it if you want, take into account the timezone).
```bash
17 4 * * * /bin/bash /path/to/your/project/scripts/renew-certs.sh
```
